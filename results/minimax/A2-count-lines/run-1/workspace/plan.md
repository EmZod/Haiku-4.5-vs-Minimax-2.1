# Task A2: Count Lines in File

## Objective
Read the file `input.txt` in the current directory, count the number of lines, and write the count to `output.txt`.

## Input
- `input.txt` - A text file with multiple lines (will be provided)

## Requirements
1. Read `input.txt` using the read tool or bash
2. Count the total number of lines
3. Write ONLY the number to `output.txt` (just the integer, no other text)

## Example
If `input.txt` contains:
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

Then `output.txt` should contain:
```
3
```

## Deliverables
- `output.txt` - containing only the line count as an integer

## Success Criteria
- `output.txt` exists
- `output.txt` contains the correct line count
- No extra files created (besides output.txt)

## DO NOT
- Include any text besides the number in output.txt
- Modify input.txt
- Create additional files
