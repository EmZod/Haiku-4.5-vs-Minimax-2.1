All 8 test cases pass. The implementation:

1. **Sorts intervals** by start time to handle unsorted input
2. **Merges overlapping/adjacent intervals** using `current[0] <= last[1]` (the `<=` handles adjacent intervals like `[1,4]` and `[4,5]`)
3. **Updates end time** with `max()` to handle nested intervals
4. **Handles edge cases**: empty list, single interval, no overlaps, all overlapping
