✅ **All 8 test cases pass!**

The `intervals.py` file has been created with the `merge_intervals` function that:

1. **Sorts intervals** by start time
2. **Merges overlapping intervals** by extending the end when intervals overlap or are adjacent (`current[0] <= last[1]`)
3. **Handles all edge cases**: empty input, single interval, no overlaps, all overlapping, adjacent intervals, nested intervals, and unsorted input
