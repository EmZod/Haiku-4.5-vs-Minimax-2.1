Done! I've created the `Counter.jsx` file with:

✅ **File created**: `Counter.jsx`
- Uses `useState` hook to manage count state (initialized at 0)
- **Increment button** - adds 1 to the count with `data-testid="increment"`
- **Decrement button** - subtracts 1 from the count with `data-testid="decrement"`
- **Count display** - shows current count with `data-testid="count"`
- Exported as default component

The component is ready to use in a React application.
