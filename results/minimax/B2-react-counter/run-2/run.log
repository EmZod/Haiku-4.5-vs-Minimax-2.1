Done! I've created `Counter.jsx` with all the requirements:

✅ **Created file**: `Counter.jsx`
- Uses `useState` hook for state management
- Has increment button (`data-testid="increment"`) that adds 1
- Has decrement button (`data-testid="decrement"`) that subtracts 1
- Displays count with `data-testid="count"` attribute
- Exported as default component
