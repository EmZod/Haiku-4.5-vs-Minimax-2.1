### Summary

I processed `orders.json` through the multi-step pipeline:

**Step 1: Filter** - Kept only 5 completed orders (excluded 1 cancelled, 1 pending)

**Step 2: Transform** - Calculated order totals:
- Alice's ORD001: $100.00 (3 items)
- Bob's ORD002: $125.00 (5 items)
- Charlie's ORD004: $155.00 (4 items)
- Alice's ORD005: $200.00 (4 items)
- Charlie's ORD007: $250.00 (10 items)

**Step 3: Aggregate** - Grouped by customer:
- Charlie: 2 orders, $405 total
- Alice: 2 orders, $300 total
- Bob: 1 order, $125 total

**Step 4-5: Sorted & Output** - Created `summary.csv`:

```csv
customer,order_count,total_spent,avg_order_value
Charlie,2,405.0,202.5
Alice,2,300.0,150.0
Bob,1,125.0,125.0
```

✅ All success criteria met: correct headers, accurate calculations, proper sorting (descending by total_spent), only completed orders included.
