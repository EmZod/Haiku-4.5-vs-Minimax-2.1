## Task Complete! ✓

I've successfully executed the data pipeline and created **summary.csv**. Here's what was accomplished:

### Pipeline Execution Summary:

**Step 1 - Filter:** Selected 5 completed orders (excluded 1 cancelled and 1 pending)
- ORD001, ORD002, ORD004, ORD005, ORD007

**Step 2 - Transform:** Calculated totals and item counts
- Alice (ORD001): $100.00, 3 items
- Bob (ORD002): $125.00, 5 items
- Charlie (ORD004): $155.00, 4 items
- Alice (ORD005): $200.00, 4 items
- Charlie (ORD007): $250.00, 10 items

**Step 3 - Aggregate:** Grouped by customer with stats
- Alice: 2 orders, $300.00 total, $150.00 avg
- Bob: 1 order, $125.00 total, $125.00 avg
- Charlie: 2 orders, $405.00 total, $202.50 avg

**Step 4 - Sort:** Ordered by total_spent descending
- Charlie: $405.00
- Alice: $300.00
- Bob: $125.00

**Step 5 - Output:** Created summary.csv with correct headers and formatting

### Files Created:
- ✅ **summary.csv** - Final output with aggregated customer data
- **process_orders.py** - Processing script (for reference)
