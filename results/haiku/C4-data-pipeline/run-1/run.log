Perfect! ✅ **Task Complete**

## Summary

I've successfully executed the multi-step data pipeline and created `summary.csv` with the following results:

### Process Executed:
1. **Filtered**: 7 orders → 5 completed orders (excluded ORD003 "cancelled" and ORD006 "pending")
2. **Transformed**: Calculated totals and item counts for each order
3. **Aggregated**: Grouped by customer with order counts and spending totals
4. **Sorted**: Ranked by total_spent in descending order
5. **Output**: Generated properly formatted CSV

### Final Results (summary.csv):
```
customer,order_count,total_spent,avg_order_value
Charlie,2,405.00,202.50
Alice,2,300.00,150.00
Bob,1,125.00,125.00
```

### Calculations Verified:
- **Charlie**: 2 orders ($155 + $250 = $405) → avg $202.50 ✓
- **Alice**: 2 orders ($100 + $200 = $300) → avg $150.00 ✓
- **Bob**: 1 order ($125) → avg $125.00 ✓

All success criteria met: correct headers, accurate calculations, proper sorting, only completed orders, and 2-decimal precision.
