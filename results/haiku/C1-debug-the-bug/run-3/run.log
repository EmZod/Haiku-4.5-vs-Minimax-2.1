## Task Complete! ✓

I've successfully debugged and fixed the bug in `buggy.py`. Here's what was done:

### The Bug
The sliding window algorithm wasn't preventing the window from moving **backwards**. On line 18, when a repeated character was found, the code would set:
```python
window_start = char_index[char] + 1
```

This could move the window backwards if the repeated character appeared before the current window start.

### The Fix
Changed to use `max()` to ensure the window only moves forward:
```python
window_start = max(window_start, char_index[char] + 1)
```

### Files Created
1. **buggy.py** - Fixed version (1 line change)
2. **test_buggy.py** - Comprehensive test suite
3. **BUG_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed explanation

### Test Results
✓ All 6 test cases passing:
- Empty string: 0
- Single char: 1
- "abcabcbb": 3
- "bbbbb": 1
- "pwwkew": 3
- "abba": 2
