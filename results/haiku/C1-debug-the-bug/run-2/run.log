Perfect! ✅ All tests pass.

## Summary

**Bug Found & Fixed:**
- **Location:** Line where `window_start` is updated
- **Issue:** `window_start = char_index[char] + 1` unconditionally moved the window start, causing it to move backward when processing repeated characters
- **Fix:** Changed to `window_start = max(window_start, char_index[char] + 1)` to ensure the window only ever moves forward

**Files Created:**
1. **`buggy.py`** - Fixed version with the minimal one-line change
2. **`test_buggy.py`** - Test suite that verifies all 6 test cases pass

The sliding window algorithm now correctly maintains that the window never shrinks, which is essential for the correctness of the longest substring without repeating characters algorithm.
