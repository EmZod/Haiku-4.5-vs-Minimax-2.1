## Summary

✅ **Bug found and fixed!**

### The Bug
The sliding window start position was being updated without checking if it should move backward:
```python
window_start = char_index[char] + 1  # ❌ Can move backward
```

### The Fix
Changed to ensure the window only moves forward:
```python
window_start = max(window_start, char_index[char] + 1)  # ✓ Never moves backward
```

### Why This Matters
Without `max()`, when a character at an old position is encountered, the window could shrink incorrectly. For example, in "abba":
- When the second 'a' is encountered at index 3, its previous position was 0
- Without the fix, `window_start` would move back to 1, losing valid characters
- With the fix, `window_start` stays at its current position if it's already further ahead

### Results
✅ All test cases now pass:
- `longest_unique_substring("")` → `0`
- `longest_unique_substring("a")` → `1`
- `longest_unique_substring("abcabcbb")` → `3`
- `longest_unique_substring("bbbbb")` → `1`
- `longest_unique_substring("pwwkew")` → `3`
- `longest_unique_substring("abba")` → `2`

**Files created:**
- `buggy.py` (fixed)
- `test_buggy.py` (verification tests)
