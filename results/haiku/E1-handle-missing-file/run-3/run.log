Perfect! I've completed the task:

1. **Attempted to read `data.json`** - The Read tool was called and correctly reported the file doesn't exist (ENOENT error)
2. **Handled the error gracefully** - Recognized the missing file error
3. **Created `report.txt`** - Successfully created the error report with the exact required content:
   - ERROR: File not found
   - Missing file: data.json
   - Status: Handled gracefully

The task is complete and meets all success criteria:
- ✅ Agent attempted to read data.json
- ✅ Agent recognized the error
- ✅ report.txt exists with correct content
- ✅ No crash or unhandled exception
- ✅ Did not create data.json
