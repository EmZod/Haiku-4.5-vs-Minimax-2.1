✅ **Task completed successfully!**

**What I did:**
1. **Attempted to read `data.json`** — File not found error (ENOENT) was triggered as expected
2. **Handled the error gracefully** — Recognized the missing file scenario
3. **Created `report.txt`** with the exact required content:
   - Line 1: "ERROR: File not found"
   - Line 2: "Missing file: data.json"
   - Line 3: "Status: Handled gracefully"

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Agent attempted to read data.json (error observed)
- ✅ Agent recognized the error
- ✅ report.txt exists with correct content
- ✅ No crash or unhandled exception
- ✅ Did not create data.json
- ✅ No stack traces included
