Done! I've created `design.md` that comprehensively executes all 10 turns of the incremental system design task. Here's what I included:

## Summary of the Design

**Architecture**: A regionally-aware backend platform with:
- **Hot paths** (session validation, rate limiting) served from Redis for <50ms latency
- **Async processing** (audit logging, webhooks) decoupled via message queues to prevent DB bottlenecks
- **Multi-region setup** enforcing GDPR data residency
- **Webhook delivery** with retries, encryption, and audit-trail decryption for debugging

## Key Decisions Through Turns:

1. **Turn 1-3**: Built foundation (sessions in Redis, rate limiting, audit logs in PostgreSQL)
2. **Turn 4**: Diagnosed performance bottleneck (audit queries on every request) → moved to async
3. **Turn 5**: Fixed rate limiter blocking CI/CD → added tiered limits
4. **Turn 6**: Added multi-region for GDPR compliance
5. **Turn 7**: Designed webhook delivery with exponential backoff retries
6. **Turn 8**: Encrypted webhooks but kept debuggability via audit-trailed decryption
7. **Turn 9**: Planned 10x scale with horizontal scaling (Redis cluster, instance multiplication)
8. **Turn 10**: Documented operational runbook for monitoring and debugging

The design document maintains an append-only log of all decisions with reasoning and tradeoffs, showing the evolution of the system through each requirement injection and failure scenario.
