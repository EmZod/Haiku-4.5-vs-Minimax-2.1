Done! I've executed the task:

1. **Read** `plan.md` - The task was to count lines in `input.txt` and write the count to `output.txt`
2. **Counted lines** in `input.txt` - Found 7 lines
3. **Created** `output.txt` - Containing just the number `7`

The task is complete and meets all requirements: the output file contains only the integer count with no extra text.
