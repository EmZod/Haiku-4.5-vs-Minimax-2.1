Perfect! ✅ **Task Complete**

I've successfully created `fizzbuzz.py` with the following implementation:

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Created `fizzbuzz.py` file
2. ✅ Implemented `fizzbuzz(n)` function that correctly handles:
   - Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 → "FizzBuzz"
   - Numbers divisible by only 3 → "Fizz"
   - Numbers divisible by only 5 → "Buzz"
   - Other numbers → string representation
3. ✅ Added `if __name__ == "__main__":` block
4. ✅ Verified output matches expected result exactly

**Output confirmed:**
```
['1', '2', 'Fizz', '4', 'Buzz', 'Fizz', '7', '8', 'Fizz', 'Buzz', '11', 'Fizz', '13', '14', 'FizzBuzz']
```
