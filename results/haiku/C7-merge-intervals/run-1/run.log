Perfect! I've successfully created the `intervals.py` file with the `merge_intervals` function. 

**Summary:**
- ✅ Created `intervals.py` with the `merge_intervals` function
- ✅ All 8 test cases pass
- ✅ Handles all edge cases:
  - Empty input
  - Single interval
  - No overlaps (returns sorted)
  - All intervals overlapping (returns single merged)
  - Adjacent intervals (touching at same point)
  - Nested intervals
  - Unsorted input

**Algorithm:**
1. Returns empty list for empty input
2. Sorts intervals by start time
3. Merges overlapping or adjacent intervals by extending the end point
4. Returns sorted merged intervals

The implementation is efficient with O(n log n) time complexity due to sorting.
