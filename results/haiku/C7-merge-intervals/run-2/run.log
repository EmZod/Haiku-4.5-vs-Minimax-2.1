## Summary

I've created **`intervals.py`** with the `merge_intervals` function that:

1. **Handles all edge cases:**
   - Empty input → returns []
   - Single interval → returns as-is
   - No overlaps → returns sorted intervals
   - All overlapping → returns single interval
   - Adjacent intervals → merges them
   - Nested intervals → returns outer interval
   - Unsorted input → sorts first

2. **Algorithm:**
   - Sort intervals by start value
   - Iterate through sorted intervals
   - Merge if current start ≤ last merged end
   - Otherwise, add as new interval

3. **Test Results:**
   - ✓ All 8 test cases pass
   - ✓ Correctly handles all specified edge cases
   - ✓ Returns intervals sorted by start

The implementation is ready for use!
