## Summary

I've created `intervals.py` with the `merge_intervals` function that:

**Implementation Details:**
- Sorts intervals by start time
- Iterates through sorted intervals, merging overlapping/touching ones
- Uses `max()` to handle nested intervals correctly
- Handles all edge cases

**All 8 test cases passed:**
1. Empty input
2. Single interval
3. Multiple overlapping intervals
4. Adjacent intervals (touching)
5. Overlapping at start boundary
6. Nested intervals
7. Complex overlapping scenario
8. Multiple overlaps requiring merging

The function correctly handles:
- Empty lists → returns `[]`
- Single intervals → returns as-is
- Non-overlapping intervals → returns sorted
- All overlapping → merges into one
- Adjacent intervals (e.g., `[1,2]` and `[2,3]`) → merges them
- Nested intervals → keeps outer boundary
- Unsorted input → sorts before processing
