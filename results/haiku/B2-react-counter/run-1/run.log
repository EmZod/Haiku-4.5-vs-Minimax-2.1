✅ **Task Complete!**

I've created `Counter.jsx` with all required elements:

- **useState hook** - Manages the count state starting at 0
- **Count display** - Element with `data-testid="count"` showing the current count
- **Increment button** - With `data-testid="increment"` that adds 1 to count
- **Decrement button** - With `data-testid="decrement"` that subtracts 1 from count
- **Default export** - Component is exported as default

The file is valid JSX and meets all success criteria from the plan.
