Done! I've created the `Counter.jsx` file with a React counter component that meets all the requirements:

✅ **Created:** Counter.jsx
- Uses `useState` hook to manage count state (starts at 0)
- Increment button adds 1 to count
- Decrement button subtracts 1 from count
- All required `data-testid` attributes present:
  - `count` on the count display
  - `increment` on the increment button
  - `decrement` on the decrement button
- Exported as default component
- No external dependencies, no class components

The component is ready for testing!
